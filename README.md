# HTML, Javascript and CSS exercises

This is a repo created with the intention of practicing javascript and you can fin different concepts used on this language through the different exercises. Most of the exercises were explain on a free course called [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). It helped me to understand the different ways we can work with an array, how to handle events, geolocation, and manipulate the use of the camera with the browser among other fun things that I enjoyed learning. Hope you can also find it useful and interesting.
